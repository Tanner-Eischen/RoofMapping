# 6. Functional Requirements
## P0: Must-have
- **High Precision Measurement**: Detect and measure roof edges, pitch, slope, and square footage.
- **Feature Identification**: Automatically detect vents, chimneys, dormers, skylights, and satellite dishes.
- **Mobile-Assisted Capture**: Guide users in capturing supplementary photos to enhance satellite data.
- **Result Exportability**: Provide shareable links, PDFs, and JSON exports.
- **Async Processing**: Queue-based ML processing with polling for results.
- **Caching**: Fast results retrieval for completed analyses.

## P1: Should-have
- **Obstruction Handling**: Accurately process data with partial obstructions like trees or shadows.
- **AR-Guided Annotations**: Support augmented reality features for detailed annotations and measurements.

## P2: Nice-to-have
- **Additional Integrations**: Expand export options to include more third-party tools.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Develop advanced visualization features for roof complexity mapping.
