# Story 4.7: Database Result Storage

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As an** ML service
**I want** to store analysis results in the database
**So that** the frontend can retrieve measurements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Database update logic in Lambda/Service pipeline
- [x] Update analysis status to "processing" when started
- [x] Create measurements record with all calculated values
- [x] Upload/store annotated image (data URL for MVP)
- [x] Store imagery/annotated URLs in measurements
- [x] Update analysis status to "completed" on success
- [x] Update status to "needs_assist" if confidence <70%
- [x] Update status to "failed" on errors (fallback path prepared)
- [x] Set completedAt timestamp

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement DB updates in pipeline (AC: 1-2)
- [x] Create measurements and store imagery/annotated URLs (AC: 3-5)
- [x] Update statuses for success/assist/failure (AC: 6-8)
- [x] Set `completedAt` timestamp (AC: 9)

## Dev Notes
- Data schema & status lifecycle: [../architecture/data-layer.md#database-schema-prisma](../architecture/data-layer.md#database-schema-prisma)
- ML pipeline result handling: [../architecture/ml-processing-pipeline.md#measurement-service](../architecture/ml-processing-pipeline.md#measurement-service)
- Storage integration: [../architecture/external-integrations.md#aws-services](../architecture/external-integrations.md#aws-services)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-47-database-result-storage](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-47-database-result-storage)

## Dependencies
- 4.5 Measurement Calculation Engine
- 6.2 AWS Infrastructure Setup (S3)
- 1.2 Database Setup with Prisma

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- Annotated images are generated or available for upload.
- Database schema includes fields for measurements and asset URLs.
- Status transitions are atomic and reliable.

## Edge Cases
- S3 upload failure; retry and mark status accordingly.
- Partial write to DB; ensure transactions or rollback behavior.
- Low confidence analysis; status set to needs_assist consistently.

### Testing
- Integration: DB writes and S3 uploads with success/failure paths.
- Status lifecycle: processing → completed/failed/needs_assist with timestamps.
- Consistency: measurement values align with calculated outputs.
