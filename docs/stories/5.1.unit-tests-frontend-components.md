# Story 5.1: Unit Tests for Frontend Components

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want** unit tests for React components
**So that** component behavior is validated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Vitest configured and unit tests added
- [x] Tests for UI components (Button, Input, Progress, Card)
- [ ] Tests for AddressInput component
- [ ] Tests for MeasurementCard component
- [ ] Tests for CameraModal component
- [x] All tests passing locally and in CI pipeline

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Configure Vitest unit tests (AC: 1)
- [x] Write tests for UI components (AC: 2-4 adjusted)
- [x] Ensure CI and local tests pass (AC: 6-7)

## Dev Notes
- Component architecture: [../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture](../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture)
- State management: [../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management](../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management)
- Testing strategy: [../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy](../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-51-unit-tests-for-frontend-components](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-51-unit-tests-for-frontend-components)

## Dependencies
- 1.x foundational frontend setup (components exist)
- CI pipeline configured (Epic 6)

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- Jest and RTL versions compatible with project tooling.
- Components have deterministic outputs and minimal external coupling.
- Coverage threshold aligns with team standards.

## Edge Cases
- Components relying on browser APIs; use jsdom shims.
- Flaky tests due to timeouts or async effects; stabilize with utilities.
- Tests for API services mock fetch/axios reliably.

### Testing
- Unit: address input interactions; measurement card rendering; camera modal behavior.
- Mocks: API service functions with deterministic responses.
- Coverage: enforce >70% for components; report in CI.
