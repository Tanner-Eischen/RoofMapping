# Story 5.2: Integration Tests for API Routes

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want** integration tests for API endpoints
**So that** backend functionality is validated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Integration tests configured via direct route handler invocation
- [x] Test: POST /api/analyze creates analysis (202)
- [x] Test: GET /api/results/[id] retrieves analysis
- [x] Test: POST /api/assist/upload handles photos (201)
- [x] Error cases covered (400: missing address/id; 404: unknown id)
- [x] In-memory DB resets between tests (rollback not applicable)
- [x] All tests passing in CI pipeline

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Configure integration test approach (AC: 1)
- [x] Write tests for analyze/results/upload (AC: 2-4)
- [x] Add error case tests (AC: 5)
- [x] Ensure isolation with in-memory DB (AC: 6)
- [x] CI pass (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- API routes architecture: [../architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-routes-architecture](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-routes-architecture)
- Data flow and caching: [../architecture/system-architecture.md#data-flow](../architecture/system-architecture.md#data-flow), [../architecture/backend-architecture.md#cache-service](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#cache-service)
- Testing strategy: [../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy](../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-52-integration-tests-for-api-routes](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-52-integration-tests-for-api-routes)

## Dependencies
- 3.x backend endpoints implemented
- 1.2 Database Setup with Prisma; 1.3 Redis

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- Tests run in isolated environment with rollback support.
- Seed data available for deterministic responses.
- Upload tests use safe temp storage.

## Edge Cases
- Network or storage provider mocks; ensure deterministic behavior.
- CORS and headers verified for results endpoint.
- Error handling consistency across routes.

### Testing
- Integration: analyze, results, upload endpoints under success and error paths.
- DB: transaction rollback and cleanup between tests.
- CI: pipeline runs tests on PRs; gates on failures.
