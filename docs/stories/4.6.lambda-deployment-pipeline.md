# Story 4.6: Lambda Deployment Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** a CI/CD pipeline for Lambda function deployment
**So that** ML service updates are automated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully
- [ ] Docker image pushed to AWS ECR
- [ ] Lambda function created/updated via AWS CLI
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- [ ] Deployment triggered on merge to main
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Lambda
- [ ] CloudWatch logging configured
- [ ] Lambda function versioning enabled

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build Dockerfile and push to ECR (AC: 1-2)
- [ ] Create/update Lambda via CLI (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow (AC: 4-5)
- [ ] Configure env and logging (AC: 6-7)
- [ ] Enable versioning (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes
- Deployment workflow: [../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#deployment-workflow](../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#deployment-workflow)
- CI/CD pipeline: [../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#ci-cd-pipeline](../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#ci-cd-pipeline)
- Environment configuration: [../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#environment-configuration](../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#environment-configuration)
- Monitoring and logs: [../architecture/monitoring-observability.md#logging-strategy](../architecture/monitoring-observability.md#logging-strategy)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-46-lambda-deployment-pipeline](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-46-lambda-deployment-pipeline)

## Dependencies
- 4.1 Lambda Handler & Service Architecture (deployment target)
- 6.2 AWS Infrastructure Setup (ECR, roles)

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- AWS ECR repository exists with correct permissions.
- GitHub Actions has access to AWS credentials/secrets.
- Lambda runtime supports container images.

## Edge Cases
- Build or push failures; retry and report with detailed logs.
- Configuration drift in Lambda env vars; ensure idempotent updates.
- Versioning and rollbacks; validate previous version fallback.

### Testing
- CI: pipeline triggers on merge; build and deploy steps succeed.
- Infra: Lambda updates reflect new image; logs available.
- Rollback: test manual or automated rollback procedure.
