# Story 5.5: Performance Testing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** to validate system performance under load
**So that** we meet our performance targets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Load testing script created (k6 or similar)
- [ ] Test: 100 concurrent users submitting analyses
- [ ] Test: API response times <200ms (p95)
- [ ] Test: ML processing <5 minutes (p95)
- [ ] Test: Database connection pool under load
- [ ] Test: Redis cache effectiveness
- [ ] Performance report generated

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement k6 (or similar) scripts (AC: 1)
- [ ] Simulate concurrent users and capture metrics (AC: 2-4)
- [ ] Validate DB and Redis under load (AC: 5-6)
- [ ] Generate performance report (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Performance targets: [../architecture/performance-scalability.md#performance-targets](../architecture/performance-scalability.md#performance-targets)
- Frontend optimization: [../architecture/performance-scalability.md#frontend-optimization](../architecture/performance-scalability.md#frontend-optimization)
- Backend optimization: [../architecture/performance-scalability.md#backend-optimization](../architecture/performance-scalability.md#backend-optimization)
- ML optimization: [../architecture/performance-scalability.md#ml-pipeline-optimization](../architecture/performance-scalability.md#ml-pipeline-optimization)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-55-performance-testing](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-55-performance-testing)

## Dependencies
- Endpoints and ML pipeline implemented (Epics 3–4)
- Monitoring available for metrics (Epic 6.5)

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P1

## Assumptions
- Load testing environment approximates production resources.
- Metrics collection configured across tiers (API, DB, Redis, ML).
- Test data generation does not pollute production.

## Edge Cases
- Throttling limits on external services; avoid or mock where needed.
- DB or Redis saturation; observe and adjust connection pools.
- ML queue backlogs; measure and report backlog metrics.

### Testing
- k6: concurrent submissions, response time p95 <200ms.
- ML: processing time p95 <5 minutes under load.
- Cache: Redis hit rate and effectiveness under stress.
