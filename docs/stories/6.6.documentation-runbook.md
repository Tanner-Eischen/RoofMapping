# Story 6.6: Documentation & Runbook

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** team member
**I want** comprehensive documentation
**So that** I can understand and maintain the system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README updated with architecture overview
- [ ] Local development setup documented
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created
- [ ] Runbook for common incidents:
  - Lambda timeout errors
  - Database connection issues
  - SQS queue backlog
  - Sentinel/USGS API failures
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI spec)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update README with architecture overview (AC: 1)
- [ ] Document local dev setup and deploy procedures (AC: 2-3)
- [ ] Document env variables (AC: 4)
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide and runbook (AC: 5-6)
- [ ] Add OpenAPI spec (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- System overview: [../architecture/system-architecture.md#system-overview](../architecture/system-architecture.md#system-overview)
- Frontend architecture: [../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture](../architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture)
- Backend architecture: [../architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-routes-architecture](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-routes-architecture)
- ML pipeline: [../architecture/ml-processing-pipeline.md#lambda-handler-architecture](../architecture/ml-processing-pipeline.md#lambda-handler-architecture)
- Documentation standards: [../architecture/development-workflow.md#documentation-standards](../architecture/development-workflow.md#documentation-standards)
- Incident response & runbooks: [../architecture/monitoring-observability.md#incident-response](../architecture/monitoring-observability.md#incident-response)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-66-documentation-runbook](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-66-documentation-runbook)

## Dependencies
- Architecture documents up to date
- OpenAPI spec tooling available (e.g., Swagger or Redocly)

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P1

## Assumptions
- Documentation will be treated as a living artifact.
- Secrets and sensitive values excluded from docs.
- Single source of truth maintained (linking rather than duplicating).

## Edge Cases
- Stale documentation due to rapid changes; enforce review cadence.
- Broken links and cross-references; add link checking.
- Incident runbooks missing steps; conduct tabletop exercises.

### Testing
- Completeness: checklist coverage for architecture, env vars, deploy, troubleshooting, runbooks.
- Integrity: automated link checker passes; no broken references.
- OpenAPI: schema validates; generated docs render correctly.
