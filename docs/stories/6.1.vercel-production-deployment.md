# Story 6.1: Vercel Production Deployment

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** to deploy the Next.js application to Vercel
**So that** users can access the application

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vercel project created and linked to GitHub
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional for MVP)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate active
- [ ] Deployment previews enabled for PRs
- [ ] Automatic deployments on main branch

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Link repo to Vercel and set env (AC: 1-2)
- [ ] Trigger production deploy and verify (AC: 3)
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL if applicable (AC: 4-5)
- [ ] Enable preview for PRs and auto-deploys (AC: 6-7)

## Dev Notes
- Deployment workflow: [../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#deployment-workflow](../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#deployment-workflow)
- Environment configuration: [../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#environment-configuration](../architecture/deployment-strategy.md#environment-configuration)
- Testing strategy on previews: [../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy](../architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy)
- PRD traceability: [../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-61-vercel-production-deployment](../prd/12-epic-and-story-structure.md#story-61-vercel-production-deployment)

## Dependencies
- Frontend application configured (Epic 1–2)
- Domain and DNS management available

## Estimate
S (small)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- Vercel account has required permissions and quotas.
- Environment variables are known and documented.
- SSL/TLS auto-provisioned via Vercel when domain is configured.

## Edge Cases
- Misconfigured environment variables causing runtime errors.
- DNS propagation delays; plan verification windows.
- Preview deployments require different env sets than production.

### Testing
- Deployment: successful build and runtime on Vercel.
- Domain: SSL active; domain resolves to deployment.
- Previews: PR preview deploys; basic smoke tests pass.
