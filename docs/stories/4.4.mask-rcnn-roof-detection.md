# Story 4.4: Mask R-CNN Roof Detection

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As an** ML service
**I want** to detect roof boundaries using Mask R-CNN
**So that** I can extract roof polygons for measurement

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Roof detector module created (`src/ml/models/maskrcnn.ts`)
- [x] Inference method stub implemented (detections with scores)
- [x] Mask-to-polygon conversion placeholder (returns polygons)
- [x] Confidence score calculation included
- [x] Handle multiple detections, select largest
- [x] Confidence threshold set to 0.7
- [x] Error handling for no detections (empty selection)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create detector module (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement inference stub and polygon conversion (AC: 3-4)
- [x] Confidence scoring and selection (AC: 5-7)
- [x] Error handling for no detections (AC: 8)

## Dependencies
- 4.2 Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery Integration
- 4.1 Lambda Handler & Service Architecture

## Estimate
M (medium)

## Priority
P0

## Assumptions
- Pretrained weights available and compatible with Detectron2 version.
- Input images are preprocessed to expected resolution and format.
- Confidence threshold tuned to balance precision/recall.

## Edge Cases
- No detections; return clear error and suggest retry with alternate tile.
- Multiple overlapping detections; select largest by area.
- Model drift or performance regressions; monitor confidence metrics.

### Testing
- Unit: inference on sample images, mask-to-polygon conversion.
- Threshold tests: confidence threshold effects; selection of largest polygon.
- Performance: inference time within target bounds.
